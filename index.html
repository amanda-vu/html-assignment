            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Amanda Vu. I'm 21 and I was born in Ottawa. I take the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College.
                I took this program because I enjoy working in design and taking this program seemed like a good chance to learn various types 
                of careers 
            </p>
