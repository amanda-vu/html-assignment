            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Amanda Vu. I'm 21 and I was born and raised in Ottawa. I take the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College.
                I took this program because I enjoy working with design and taking this program seemed like a good chance to learn various skills 
                for many different design career paths like a web developer, video editor, graphic designer, photographer, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've enjoyed drawing and art since I was a little kid. I liked it because it was a way to express creativity on paper and it was always satisfying to see the final product of great efforts.
                Drawing was also a stress reliever for me and it was something that was able to give me peace of mind. As I got older, I realized I really like designing things. I design things like clothing, shoes, posters and logos. 
            </p>
